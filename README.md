## **Announcement: Blum Panel Closure**
> Good evening everyone, 
> **I'm making this announcement to officially end the development and close Blum Panel.**

> After a long period of **inactivity**, I've decided to stop this project due to **lack of time **and motivation, in order to focus on more concrete and interesting things. Even during development, I had very little time.

### History

> Early 2024, I decided to bring this project back from the shelf. Originally planned two years earlier, it had already been abandoned once with my former partner. I initially started with the same PHP base, but I didn't like it, and the old code was of poor quality. So, I started from scratch to offer something more complete and of better quality. 
> *Here’s the unreleased trailer of the version that was supposed to launch: https://streamable.com/6jsz13.*
> **Unfortunately**, due to some issues with the API using PHP, I decided to rewrite everything in JS, and eventually rebuilt the panel in React under the Next.js framework.

> Now, the last commit on the Next.js version is over three months old, and building this service no longer interests me.

> However, we still managed to create in the past months :

- A complete server managing system : https://streamable.com/6jsz13,
- Quack Force SSV (originating from Garry's Mod): https://streamable.com/meu9hc
- The Untitled Visual (also from Garry's Mod), 
- GLADOS Visual (original, based on Portal),
- Pure System Update Visual (also from Garry's Mod) : https://streamable.com/2v4jh1

> :blum_haxor:***I want to make it clear that the Blum Panel source code will never be for sale. It may become open source one day, but don’t count on it too much – the code is really messy.***  
> `There's also a chance the project could reopen, but it would be in a completely different form.`

> *`For a reliable panel, I recommend that you do your own research, as there are many out there. Be careful about the identity of the people behind them. Avoid scams and, above all, never entrust your personal data to just anyone - it's valuable.`*

> *`The use of our name, logo and visuals for your own projects is totally forbidden.`*
